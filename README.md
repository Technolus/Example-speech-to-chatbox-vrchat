# speech-to-chatbox
a very simple speech-to-text python script for vrchat, that's all you get

how to use (assuming vrchat is up and running):

  1. install the modules mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
  you can do so by running the following command in a terminal such as CMD in the directory where the requirements.txt file is found
  ```
  py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  2. run the script `stc.py` using your favorite interpreter.
  3. press the "F" key each time you want to be heard by the application,
  once the speech has been properly processed,
  it'll turn into text and be sent to the vrchat's chatbox.
